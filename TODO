When no note subject is entered, set default subject name as DD:MM:YY HH:MM:SS
Accept shift enter for multiple line notes
Up key should fetch the existing note content to the buffer while entering a new note content
add esc input for escaping out of enter name/content prompts
each program close should create a new version of source files, keeping a total of 10 for file pool size, for redundancy purposes
